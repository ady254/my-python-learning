# What is boolean?
# Boolean is a data type that can have only two values: True or False

# Example:
print(10 > 5)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)

# Output:
# True
# False
# False

# Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False
a = 200 
b = 33

if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("b is not greater than a") 

# Output:
# b is not greater than a
