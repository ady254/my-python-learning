# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
# Comments Start with #

#Example 

print("Hello Python") #This is a comment

#print("Hello Python") 
print("Hi I'm Python")

# A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:


# Multi-line Comments
   #Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

   #To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

   # Example:

   #This is a comment
   #written in
   #more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")


   
# Since Python ignores string literals that are not assigned to any variable, you can use triple-quoted strings to write multi-line comments in your program.
