# Introduction to Python
    #Welcome to the first chapter of the Python Learning Journey!

    #The programming language we are learning is called Python, created by a developer named Guido van Rossum in the early 90s.
    #Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
    #Python is designed to be easy to read, which makes it the perfect language for beginners.
    #It's also super versatile and used in the following areas:
        #Data analysis & visualization
        #Artificial intelligence (AI)
        #Machine learning (ML)
        #Web development
        #And more!




#Python Indentation

    #Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    #Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    #Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

#CODE EXAMPLE

if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two! ")

# SyntaxError: Example
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

#Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
#The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:


#Python Variables
#In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
print(x)
print(y)

#Comments
#In Python, we use the hash symbol # to add comments to our code.

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
